Tickety


Description

Tickety is a simple web application that provides a platform for easy distribution and access to tickets for events. It achieves its purpose by first being a platform where event organisers can register their events including details and in turn, people who would like to attend the event can easily buy tickets from the platform. This renders the transaction between event organisers and event attendees more seamless, as it cancels the need to print out tickets and it makes tickets available to everyone at a go.



Requirements

Tickety only requires a user to have a web browser and an internet connection. At this moment, no downloadable version of the application has been made. It can be accessed from a computer, phone, tablet and any device that allows you to navigate through the web by following the link to the website.


Usage

The use of Tickety is divided in two parts depending on the kind of user.
The first kind of user is a merchant or an event-oganising agency; who are capable of creating accounts and logging in to the application to create and post events. Once an event is posted by a merchant, the second user, a buyer, is now capable of buying a ticket. The application contains a section where users can browse currently available events and select which events they wish to attend.
